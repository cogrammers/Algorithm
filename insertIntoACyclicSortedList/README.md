Given a node from a cyclic linked list which has been sorted, write a function to insert a value into the list such that it remains a cyclic sorted list. The given node can be any single node in the list. Return the inserted new node.

```
3->5->1 is a cyclic list, so 3 is next node of 1.
3->5->1 is same with 5->1->3
```

#### Example
Given a list, and insert a value 4:
3->5->1
Return 5->1->3->4
