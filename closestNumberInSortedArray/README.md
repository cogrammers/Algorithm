Given a target number and an integer array A sorted in ascending order, find the index i in A such that A[i] is closest to the given target.

Return -1 if there is no element in the array.

###### Example
Given [1, 2, 3] and target = 2, return 1.

Given [1, 4, 6] and target = 3, return 1.

Given [1, 4, 6] and target = 5, return 1 or 2.

Given [1, 3, 3, 4] and target = 2, return 0 or 1 or 2
