# Algorithm

What is inside this repo?
Each folder contains a algorithm questions, and some test (if it is written in ruby).

On the top of each question, there is a brief description of the question, input output, difficulty level and related tags.

How to ran it?
Java solution:
1. Open https://codepad.remoteinterview.io/pads in browser.
2. Pause the solution in the editor and hit "run" on the bottom.

Ruby solution:
1. Open the terminal and clone the folder.
2. Direct inside the folder and ran Rspec file.

How do we do this one?
1. We can vote the topic for the next meetup and do flash talk(15min?).
2. Have someone talks about it during the meetup.(more like a short class?? it may be really dry!)
